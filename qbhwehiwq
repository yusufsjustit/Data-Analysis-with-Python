For and While Loop Exercises
Question 1: Create a for loop that counts from 0 to 10, and prints odd numbers to the screen. Use the skeleton below:
for i in range(1, 11):
    # Line of code.
        # Line of code.
Question 2: Create a while loop that counts from 0 to 10, and prints odd numbers to the screen. Use the skeleton below:
x = 1
while x < 11:
    # Line of code.
        # Line of code.
    # Line of code.
Question 3: Create a program with a for loop and a break statement. The program should iterate over characters in an email address, exit the loop when it reaches the @ symbol, and print the part before @ on one line. Use the skeleton below:
for ch in "john.smith@pythoninstitute.org":
    if ch == "@":
        # Line of code.
    # Line of code.

Question 4: Create a program with a for loop and a continue statement. The program should iterate over a string of digits, replace each 0 with x, and print the modified string to the screen. Use the skeleton below:
for digit in "0165031806510":
    if digit == "0":
        # Line of code.
        # Line of code.
    # Line of code.
 
Question 5: What is the output of the following code?
n = 3
 
while n > 0:
    print(n + 1)
    n -= 1
else:
    print(n)

Question 6: What is the output of the following code?
for i in range(0, 6, 3):
    print(i)
 
 
 
1) for i in range(0, 11): if i % 2 != 0: print(i)
2) x = 1 while x < 11: if x % 2for ch in "john.smith@pythoninstitute.org": 3) if ch == "@": break print(ch, end="")  != 0: print(x) x += 1
4) for digit in "0165031806510": if digit == "0": print("x", end="") continue print(digit, end="")
